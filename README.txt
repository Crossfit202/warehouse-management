This is my folder for Project 1 - Warehouse Inventory Management System

This project was built with Springboot backend, Angular Front End (the project description says react but I got special permission to use angular since I was being deployed to a client that uses angular), and Postgresql DB. 

In order to sign in, you will need a PostgresDB named "inventory". 

Run the createDB.sql file -> then the insertData.sql file -> then you will have default users for each permission you can login with: 
Username: admin_user, manager_user, clerk_user, regular_user
password for all: securepassword
